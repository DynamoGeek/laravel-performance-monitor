# Laravel Performance Monitor

Dealer Inspire Laravel Performance Monitor logs errors when your Laravel application exceeds specified performance metrics.

## Installation

Install the package by requiring it with Composer.

You can, however, modify some configuration options by publishing this package and updating `performancemonitor.php`.

### To Publish
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```

### Available configuration options
**enable_execution_time_check (default true)** - Set to true to enable a check for maximum execution time

**enable_memory_limit_check (default true)** - Set to true to enable a check for a memory usage threshold

**execution_time_max_seconds (default 300)** - The maximum number of seconds a request execution can take before sending an alert

**memory_limit_max_memory_percent (default 80)** - The maximum percentage of available memory that can be used before sending an alert
